== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why I am not able to find any menu link in my WordPress Dashboard? =
Because there is no such link or menu item. If you need any customization feel free to ask at [WordPress.org forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/jquery-smooth-scroll)

= Can I use a custom icon? =

Yes, just overwrite the arrow.png image or use the included PSD to tweak.

= Can I adjust the point when the icon/link appears? =

Yes, just edit the upperLimit value in js/jss-script.min.js.

= Why everything looks weird in js and css files? =

Because these files are compressed. I have included reader friendly files i.e. js/jss-script.min.js and css/jss-style.js

= I don't want to add a plugin. How do I add these functionality without a plugin? =
Of course you can do this. I will add a blog post about how to do this without any plugin. But remember, you can't get automatic upgrade in this condition. BTW, Follow [BlogSynthesis](http://www.blogsynthesis.com) for any update.
